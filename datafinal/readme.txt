R scripts for analysis of stakeholder perceptions of desirable monitoring outcomes

The following scripts relate to the following figures

Fig 1: dartdiag.R
Fig 2a and b: walktrapdendro4.R
Fig 2c: edge_clustering-fin.R
Fig 3: connectivity2a.R
Supplementary material: 3netscomp2a.R

Some scripts have dependencies on previous scripts (please see top of scripts for details)
Saving of graphs requires creation of a "fig" folder in the working directory
Saving of some intermediate data files requires creation of a "dataReady" folder in the working directory

Orientation of networks may differ on each run due to random placement of the first node during plotting.
